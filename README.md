# GameStore
This project uses a RESTful API to serve data to a PostgreSQL database. 
The available database has two tables (video games and board games) with CRUD operations. With video games, for example:
Get all video games.
Get video games by ID.
Add video games.
Update video games by ID.
Delete video games by ID.
